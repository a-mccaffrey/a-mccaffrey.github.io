Responsive Portfolio
The task was to create a responsive porfolio using bootstrap, HTML, CSS, our own personal information, and images. I tried to make the appearance look nice, too.

One ask was to make a sticky footer, which, when I did it, ended up cutting through my portfolio page as the content is greater in height than the browser. So I decided to change it to a footer that stays at the bottom of the screen no matter what's on the page. 

I tried, for the most part, to stick to the design example we were given. The only time I strayed was in the navigation bar which I kept as bootstrap designed it with Javascript in mobile so that it looks elegant as it unfolds.

I used semantic HTML wherever I could but obviously a lot of bootstrap just uses divs along with their own classification system for the styling. There was no specified "header" area so I couldn't use that, for instance, but I did use "main".

Putting the words on top of the images in the portfolio section was pretty tricky but I'm happy with how it turned out.

Hope you like it!
